# Stroke Risk Prediction Model
A predictive model using Logistic Regression to determine the risk of heart disease in patients, developed using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. 

## Project Overview
This project builds a model to assist in early diagnosis and potential intervention of heart disease by predicting disease presence based on patient medical attributes.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- This dataset contains attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and others.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaswanthaitha21/heart_disease_predictor.git
cd heart_disease_predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
